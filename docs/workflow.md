# Modding Workflow

## Mod Locations

Bullethell X loads mods from two sources:

1. Steam Workshop – for published mods.
2. Local Mods – located in `bx/mods` under the game's installation folder.
This is where you’ll be working during development.

To get started, place your mod files in the `bx/mods` folder, and the game will automatically detect them.

## Enabling Local Mods

- While in game, press `Backspace` once.

- You should see on the top left: `Developer Mode: Local Mods Enabled`.

- (Optional) Press `Backspace` to toggle mod settings.
It is recommended to disable Steam Workshop mods while developing,
so they don’t interfere with your work.

## Publishing Your Mod

Once your mod is ready, simply use the in-game uploader!

After publishing, players can subscribe to your mod on the
Steam Workshop and enjoy it directly in their game.
