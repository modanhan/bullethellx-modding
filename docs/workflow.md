# Modding Workflow

## Mod Locations

Bullethell X loads mods from two sources:

1. Steam Workshop – for published mods.
2. Local Mods – located in `bx/mods`. This is where you’ll be working during development.

To get started, place your mod files in the `bx/mods` folder, and the game will automatically detect them.

## Enabling Local Mods

- Open the in-game Settings menu.

- Ensure Local Mods are enabled.

- (Optional) Disable Steam Workshop mods while developing, so they don’t interfere with your work.

## Publishing Your Mod

Once your mod is ready:

- Use `steamcmd` to upload your mod. (In-game uploading is currently in development.)

- After publishing, players can subscribe to your mod on the Steam Workshop and enjoy it directly in their game.
